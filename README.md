This is a backend coding mini-project I worked on using NodeJS and TypeScript implementing a TCP server

(1) Navigate to the root of the directory.

(2) Have Node installedâ€”I used:
    Node v15.9.0
    npm 7.5.3

(3) Run npm install to download all relevant dependencies.

(4) Run npm start to start the TCP server.

(5) Run npm test to run the test suite.
